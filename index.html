After accepting an athletic scholarship
 to play at the University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991 national 
 championship team, but largely spent his four college football
  years in backup roles behind elite players, including future NFL
   player and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp.
   Johnson aspired to play professional football but went undrafted
    in the 1995 NFL Draft. Following his graduation, he signed with 
    the Calgary Stampeders but was cut from the team in his first 
    season.[13] In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky, a longtime professional 
    wrestler, assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF.
     Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he 
     employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left WWE 
     in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013,
      making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019.
       A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's 
       first of African-American descent, he is also a two-time
        Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, 
        the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. 
        Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view 
        (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched 
        episodes of WWE's flagship television series (Raw and SmackDown)
